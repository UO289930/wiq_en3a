== Solution Strategy
This section will cover all the technological, architectural, design and organizational decisions made along the project for its appropiate development

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies, that shape system architecture. It includes

* technology decisions
* decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g. usage of an architectural pattern or design pattern
* decisions on how to achieve key quality goals
* relevant organizational decisions, e.g. selecting a development process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.

.Motivation
These decisions form the cornerstones for your architecture. They are the foundation for many other detailed decisions or implementation rules.

.Form
Keep the explanations of such key decisions short.

Motivate what was decided and why it was decided that way,
based upon problem statement, quality goals and key constraints.
Refer to details in the following sections.

=== Technologies
* *React*: JavaScript library for web and native user interfaces. It allows developers to create interactive web applications by breaking down the UI into reusable components. React uses a declarative approach to efficiently update and render components, resulting in faster and more maintainable code. It's widely adopted in the industry due to its simplicity, performance, and robustness.
* *Node.js*: JavaScript runtime that enables running JavaScript code outside of web browsers. It's renowned for its event-driven architecture and extensive collection of packages, making it ideal for building scalable server-side applications.
    + *Express.js*: Express.js, often simply called Express, is a minimalist web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building web applications by providing a robust set of features, including middleware support, routing, and templating engines. Express is known for its flexibility, simplicity, and performance, making it a popular choice for developing web applications and APIs in Node.js.
* *Wikidata*: Wikidata provides a REST API for retrieving information related to any topic. It helps us to dynamically generate questions for our game using it from any programming language. 
* *MongoDB*: popular NoSQL database known for its flexibility and scalability. It stores data in flexible JSON-like documents and is widely used in modern web development for its simplicity and ability to handle large volumes of data.
* *SonarCloud*: Cloud-based service provided by SonarSource, which offers continuous code quality analysis and automated code reviews for software development projects. It helps developers identify and fix bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells in their codebase to improve overall software quality.
* *Arc42*: framework (template) used for documenting and communicating software architectures. It provides a template for describing the architecture of a software system, covering aspects such as stakeholders, requirements, architecture decisions, components, interfaces, and quality attributes. arc42 helps teams create consistent and comprehensible architecture documentation, enabling better communication, understanding, and maintenance of software systems throughout their lifecycle.
* *npm*: default package manager for Node.js, providing a command-line interface to install, manage, and publish JavaScript packages. With over a million packages available in its registry, npm simplifies adding functionality to Node.js projects by handling dependencies and providing tools for versioning and publishing packages.
* *Docker*: platform that will be used for deploying our services inside containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that contain everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Docker enables developers to package their applications along with all dependencies into containers, ensuring consistency across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.
* *GitHub Actions*: built-in automation tool on GitHub that allows us to automate some workflows that are triggered after some specific github branches actions at development. It provides as continuous integration of the game functionality.
* *Gatling*: Load test tool that allows us to record some user interaction from our application and simulate it as if various differnet users were accessing the application.
* *Prometheus*: monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It collects metrics from configured targets at specified intervals, stores them efficiently, and provides a powerful query language for analyzing and alerting on these metrics. It's particularly well-suited for dynamic environments like cloud-native applications and microservices architectures.
* *Grafana*: open-source platform for monitoring and observability, providing customizable dashboards and visualization tools for analyzing metrics, logs, and other data sources. It allows users to create dynamic, interactive dashboards to monitor the health and performance of their systems and applications.

=== Technological decisions

At the beggining of the project, the team decided to develop the wikidata API by means of .NET technology and C# programming language. 
As part of continuous integration, the application was attempted to be deployed without success due to docker issues with .NET container. 
Therefore, the team decided to migrate the whole API to Node.js using javascript and express framework.
As a conclusion, it was worth spending time making the migration for reducing the number of potential issues at deployment time.

=== Architecture & Design

* *Microservices*: is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. Each service is independently deployable, scalable, and can be developed using different programming languages, frameworks, or databases.
In a microservices architecture, each service typically represents a specific business function or capability and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs. This enables teams to work independently on different parts of the application, allowing us to divide the work into different teams avoiding bottlenecks during production.
* *API Gateway*: centralized service that acts as an intermediary between clients and microservices. It serves as a single entry point for all client requests, providing various functionalities by means of routing and redirecting to the specific service in charge of that request They play a crucial role in building scalable and efficient distributed systems by abstracting away complexities and providing a unified interface for clients to interact with all available services.
* *API*: using microservices architecture enforces us to isolate each of the microservices and create well-defined interfaces for accesing those microservices from common gateway, reducing dependencies between services and allowing them to evolve independently. Well-defined interfaces imply not only services' independance, but also team members independecance since nobody will need to wait for others for starting working themselves.  


=== Team Organization

For developing this project we are using Github as the control version systems. 
The master branch contains the final version of the product, so that every accepted pull request to master branch will be considered as a new release.
The production branch contains the work in production right now, from where everybody should create their own branch for their specific code development. 

* *Documentation*: it must be always updated for making our work valuable and consistent.
* *Weekly meetings*: Weekly discussions about what has been done and what needs to be done will be key for our team success. 
* *Github*: this control version systems not only allows us to share and collabortively write code, but also provides other resources such as issues and project management (kanban board) tools for organizing the work to be done. Also, wiki section allows us to save all of our minutes from each scheduled meeting.
* *Whatsapp*: will allow us to be in constant communication for helping each other out whenever needed. 
* *Discord*: useful for making unofficial meetings and making decisions whenever is impossible for all of us to be present in an specific place.
