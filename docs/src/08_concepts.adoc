== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* models, especially domain models
* architecture or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of an overarching (= cross-cutting) nature
* implementation rules


.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity) of the architecture. 
Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks, e.g. security or safety. 


.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== Domain Concepts

==== Question

In our app, the question is always represent as a data structure with the next format: 

[listing]
----
{
    text: "What is the capital of Asturias?"
    answers: [Gijón,Oviedo,Cangas de Onís]
    correctAnswer: 1
    wikiLink: "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q14317"
}
----


*Benefits:*

- Consistency: This format ensures consistent representation of questions throughout the app, reducing errors and simplifying code maintenance.
- Clarity: By explicitly defining the data format, developers can clearly understand how to work with question data within the codebase.
- Flexibility: By defining an array and a correct index, the array could be of multiple sizes.


=== UX Concepts

==== Color 

We decided to use a color palette of 4 colors:


[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Name | Color
| Background | +++<span style="padding: 5px;background-color: #191919;color: #f2ecff; font-weight:bold">#191919</span>+++
| Text| +++<span style="padding: 5px; background-color: #191919;color: #f2ecff; font-weight:bold"></span>+++
| Primary | +++<span style="padding: 5px; background-color: #191919; color: #00c896; font-weight:bold">#00c896</span>+++
| Danger | +++<span style="padding: 5px; background-color: #191919; color: #e35a2a; font-weight:bold">#e35a2a</span>+++
|===

*Benefits:*

 - Clarity: Thanks to this simple palette it is very easy to identify when something is correct or not.
 - Consistency: By using a limited set of colors, the overall visual design of the application will be cohesive and harmonious.
 - Accessibility: The chosen colors provide good contrast ratios, ensuring the content is readable and accessible for users with various visual abilities.
 - Branding: The selected colors can be used to reinforce the application's brand identity and make it recognizable to users.

The chosen color palette strikes a balance between functionality, aesthetics, and branding. The dark background with light text provides a high-contrast theme that is easy on the eyes, while the primary and danger colors are used sparingly to highlight important information or actions.





=== Development concepts

==== Testing and Monitoring
We performed Load Testing, Unit Testing, End-to-end testing and Code Analysis with SonarCloud.
The results obtained can be checked here: <<section-appendix1>>

==== Configurability
The application has simple configurable game features for selecting between two game modes (normal/usual and trivia game mode) and two difficulty levels (easy and hard difficulties).
 - Normal mode game consists of 10 random questions with an amount of time to answer the question before losing the possibility to answer. Easy and hard modes differ on the amount of time that the user has to answer the question. 
 - Trivia mode game consists of 10 questions, which are generated based on the resulting category of rolling a dice. There are 6 possible categories: sports, science, history, geography and entertainment.
Additionally, there is an option at the main application view where random music can be played.

==== Data access
The development team has followed two different approaches for supporting data access from the running application for development and production.
While developing the application, teh development team decided to create a shared database located in the cloud which allowed us to work locally with the same data by means of a key string.
In order to move our application into production by means of deploying it into an Azure virtual machine running with Docker containers, the development team created a mongodb container with an associated volumen for making the data persistent.
