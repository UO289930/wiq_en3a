== Architecture Decisions

Along the process of developing the application, decisions had to be taken as problems arise.
These are the final decicision that we have made according to their advantages.
If you want a description about each of the technologies we have chosen, go to the xref:#section-glossary[Glossary] of the documentation.
The following table contains the most interesting the design decisions that we have taken with their advantages and disadvantages:

.Architectural Records
|===
|Code|Decision|Advantages|Disadvantages
|ADR1| React.js | Quite easy to learn in comparison to other front-end libraries. Increasingly popular in the web.| Not all of us know about its usage
|ADR2| Tawilwind CSS | Consistent and unified design system and its ability to speed up the development process. Rapidly growing utility-first CSS framework | Quite new for most of us
|ADR3| MongoDB | It does not need to be started manually. Free and easy to understand| We are quite new with MongoDB.
|ADR4| Docker | Fast deployment, ease of moving/maintaining your applications. Easy as we already have DockerFiles example| We do not have much experience using Docker
|ADR5| PlantUML | Allows drawing diagrams very easily, with a simple syntax.| Does not allow as much control over the exact layout of the elements in the diagram as other tools.
|ADR6| Node.js | For small applications it's a very fast techonology. It's easy to learn and we already know a bit about it| Its performance is reduced with heavy computational tasks

.Contents
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationales.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented
here in this central section or whether you better document it locally
(e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. 
Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

.Motivation
Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

.Form
Various options:

* ADR (https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions[Documenting Architecture Decisions]) for every important decision
* List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:
* more detailed in form of separate sections per decision

.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-9/[Architecture Decisions] in the arc42 documentation.
There you will find links and examples about ADR.
