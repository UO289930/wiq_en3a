== Building Block View

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes, interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations, data structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

image::05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-5/[Building Block View] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Whitebox Overall System

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

 * an overview diagram
 * a motivation for the decomposition
 * black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
 In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
 restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

Motivation::

This is a basic introduction to the app, highlighting the external services it uses and how they work together.

Contained Building Blocks::

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| STAP  | It’s the main application, currently represented as a whitebox. The following sections will break it down in detail.
| WikidataAPI | External API used as the knowledge hub.
|===


=== Level 1

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 1 as white boxes.

You have to decide which building blocks of your system are important enough to justify such a detailed description.
Please prefer relevance over completeness. Specify important, surprising, risky, complex or volatile building blocks.
Leave out normal, simple, boring or standardized parts of your system

actor user as "User browser"
frame STAP {
    node Frontend
    node UserManagement
    node WikidataService
    node Gateway
}
cloud Wikidata as "Wikidata"

user -- Frontend
Frontend -- Gateway
Gateway -- UserManagement
Gateway -- WikidataService
WikidataService -- Wikidata
....



Motivation::

The reasoning behind this separation is to achieve a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns. 
It also allows to expose the user management and the question generation as APIs.

Contained Building Blocks::

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| Frontend  | Represents the user interface and manages the quiz logic of the application.
| User Management | Handles everything related to user accounts.
| Wikidata Service | Generates questions from Wikidata data.
| Gateway |Acts as a central hub for managing API traffic.
|===

Important Interfaces::

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Description**
| Frontend -> User Management  | This interface defines how the frontend communicates with the User Management Service to log in, retrieve user data, or perform actions requiring authorization.
| Frontend -> Wikidata Service | This interface defines how the Question Generator Service delivers processed questions to the frontend for display.
| Wikidata Service -> Wikidata API | This interface represents the service fetching data from the Wikidata API.

Insert your explanations of black boxes from level 1:

If you use tabular form you will only describe your black boxes with name and
responsibility according to the following schema:

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| _<black box 1>_ | _<Text>_
| _<black box 2>_ | _<Text>_
|===



If you use a list of black box descriptions then you fill in a separate black box template for every important building block .
Its headline is the name of the black box.
****


[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe <black box 1>
according the the following black box template:

* Purpose/Responsibility
* Interface(s), when they are not extracted as separate paragraphs. This interfaces may include qualities and performance characteristics.
* (Optional) Quality-/Performance characteristics of the black box, e.g.availability, run time behavior, ....
* (Optional) directory/file location
* (Optional) Fulfilled requirements (if you need traceability to requirements).
* (Optional) Open issues/problems/risks



_<Purpose/Responsibility>_

_<Interface(s)>_

=== Level 2

[role="arc42help"]

Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 1 as white boxes.

You have to decide which building blocks of your system are important enough to justify such a detailed description.
Please prefer relevance over completeness. Specify important, surprising, risky, complex or volatile building blocks.
