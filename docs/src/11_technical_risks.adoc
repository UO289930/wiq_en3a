== Risks and Technical Debts

This section contains a list of identified risks that the project will face during its lifetime. In addition to it, each particular risk comes with a brief 
self-explanatory description, the probability of its occurrence, its impact on the project and a solution on how to minimize it or mitigate it.

=== Risks

|===
| Risk | Description | Probability | Impact | Solution

|*Complications with the project characteristics*
| Almost everyone on the team has never done a project of such a size, and there may be some trouble.
| Medium 
| High
| Each member will try to maximize its knowledge on some aspect of the project in the first weeks, in order to be able to be something similar to a leader in each one of the posible key aspects of the project.

|*Problems with C#*
| As a team we decided to try .NET to code the API of wikidata.
| High
| High
| The team will practice with the language to be able to do a good job when implementing the back-end.

|*Problems with wikidata*
| The team only used wikidata once before and not even everyone of us.
| High

| We must read some documentation and try out some basic features to familiarize with wikidata.

|*Teamwork issues*
| The members of the team have never worked together. This may cause problems such as lack of communication or trust in each other's work.
| Medium
| Medium
| We will try to keep in touch a few times a week, to see each ones progress on our tasks and we will try to build some confidence with each other throughout the development of the project as most of us met on this subject. 

|*Differences with technologies*
| There are some members that don't know as much in some aspects of the development
| Medium
| Low
| The members that know more on each of the aspects will help the others understand the things they could find difficult.

|*Deadlines*
| The project is based on some deadline days when our work is presented
| Very high

=== Technical Debts

.Wikidata
The day when wikidata is outdated could come, and the app could still be working. It's quite difficult but it could happen.

.Availability
The fact of using wikidata for retrieving the questions could mean that if the service of wikidata fails for some reason, the app would be failing as well.

.Contents
A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by priority

.Motivation
“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister, Atlantic Systems Guild.) 

This should be your motto for systematic detection and evaluation of risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.

.Form
List of risks and/or technical debts, probably including suggested measures to minimize, mitigate or avoid risks or reduce technical debts.
