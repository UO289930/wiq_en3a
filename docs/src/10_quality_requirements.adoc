== Quality Requirements


[role="arc42help"]
****

.Content
This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority,
which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.

.Motivation
Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural
decisions you should know for every stakeholder what is really important to them,
concrete and measurable.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-10/[Quality Requirements] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Tree
image::10-Quality-Tree-EN.png["Quality Tree"]

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The quality tree (as defined in ATAM – Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.

.Motivation
The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a sometimes large number of quality requirements.

.Form
The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and requirements:

* tree-like refinement of the term "quality". Use "quality" or "usefulness" as a root
* a mind map with quality categories as main branches

In any case the tree should include links to the scenarios of the following section.

=== Quality Scenarios

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Concretization of (sometimes vague or implicit) quality requirements using (quality) scenarios.

These scenarios describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at the system.

For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

* Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case scenarios) describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s request within one second.
* Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.

.Motivation
Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to
more easily measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.

Especially when you want to assess your architecture using methods like
ATAM you need to describe your quality goals (from section 1.2)
more precisely down to a level of scenarios that can be discussed and evaluated.

*Usage scenarios*

[options="header", cols="1,2,2,2"]
|===
| Quality goal | Motivation | Usage scenario | Priority

| *Reliability* 
| The application must provide users with constistent performance and predictable results. 
| When users access the web it must behave the same every time giving the almost equal results and response times.
| Very high

| *Performance*
| The application must have a reasonable response time. Slow applications are not positively popular in society.
| The application must be able to give a response time of at least 5 seconds with 10 concurrent users.
| Very high

| *Security*
| Our web must be secure not only to protect data but to provide a realiable solution to our users. If we can't assure our clients the web is secure, no one will use it.
| Data will be only accessible by its owner. If a user tries to access other people's information, the system will deny the operation, as data will be stored in a secure system.
| Very high

| *Usability* 
| To make the website stand out from the competition, it must be easy to use, attract attention and be aestethic.
| The user must be able to do identify the game elements shown in the screen as well as the menu for the different functionalities as the view profile or the logout ones.
| Very high

| *Portability* 
| To reach the maximum number of users the application must work in the maximum number of infrastructures. 
| The game experience and functionalities must be the same independently from the device which the user is connecting from.
| High

| *Testability* 
| All features of the application must be testable in order to verify that the web built was the one asked for.
| The unit tests passed by the developers must generate an observable output.
| High

| *Availability* 
| The application must be available 24 hours a day all weeks. 
| The user must be able to play at any time because it will be its free time.
| High

|===


*Change scenarios*

[options="header", cols="1,2,2,2"]
|===
| Quality goal | Motivation | Change scenario | Priority
| *Maintainability*
| An application should be maintainable to remain usable over the years and to be able to improve functionalities and to fix misfunctionalities.
| When developers must introduce a new feature to the web, they should be able to do it without changing the software architecture.
| High
