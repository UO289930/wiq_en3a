== Introduction and Goals

The WIQ web application is developed by HappySw for RTVE to create an experimental version of the Saber y Ganar quiz show. 
The primary goal of WIQ is to provide users with an engaging platform where they can participate in quiz games,
answer questions generated from Wikidata, and win prizes.

This document outlines the essential requirements guiding the software architects and development team in creating WIQ.

[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include
* underlying business goals, 
* essential features, 
* essential functional requirements, 
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
****

=== Requirements Overview
 
The system aims to fulfill the following essential requirements:

1. Users can register and login to participate in quiz games.
2. Questions are automatically generated from data available in Wikidata.
3. Users receive historical data of their participation, including the number of games played, questions passed and failed, and timestamps.
4. Each question must be answered within a specific time limit.
5. Questions consist of one correct answer and several distractors, all automatically generated.
6. Access to user information and generated questions is available through an API.

.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Goals

|===
| Quality Goal | Description
| Reliability  | Ensure consistent and accurate question generation and user data management.
| Performance  | Optimize system response times and capacity to handle multiple user interactions simultaneously.
| Security     | Implement robust security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities

=== Stakeholders

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
